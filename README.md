<h1>SnackSphere</h1>
<p>The primary goal of this project is to ensure an exceptional user experience for visitors to their snack shop's website and mobile app.</p>
<p>UX/UI designers Gabriela Lucía Nesheim, Ja’Miya Myles, and Joi Hargrove All worked together as Design Team Thinkalikes. They implemented ideas and design decisions based on the user research they complied through the duration of building this website.</p>
<p>I used React & TailwindCSS to develop this website and bring their idea to life.</p>
